1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,240
Speaker 1: And that's it. 

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,200
Speaker 1: Congratulations on completing the course. 

3
00:00:04,360 --> 00:00:11,050
Speaker 1: In this lesson, we'll recap what we've built, discuss best practices, and explore next steps for continuing your journey in vibe coding. 

4
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:15,810
Speaker 1: So we've just built some pretty amazing applications without writing any code at all. 

5
00:00:15,890 --> 00:00:28,650
Speaker 1: And the amazing thing and what we did was that we built two production ready apps, not just toy demos, that were full stack with persistent storage and deploy 5 to their own URL for anyone to access.

6
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:32,320
Speaker 1: Again, we wrote little or really no code and it was all logic. 

7
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,400
Speaker 1: It was all the concepts that we discussed at the beginning of this course. 

8
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,860
Speaker 1: So what were those concepts as well? 

9
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:44,970
Speaker 1: And how to do with thinking and how to do with frameworks and debugging and checkpoints and context. 

10
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:51,990
Speaker 1: So let's do a quick review of everything we Learned before we move on to some next steps in your vibe coding journey.

11
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:55,720
Speaker 1: So in our very first lesson, we talked about five skills. 

12
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:58,800
Speaker 1: Those were thinking, framework checkpoints, debugging, and context. 

13
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,390
Speaker 1: In thinking, we discussed a logical hierarchy for thought. 

14
00:01:03,470 --> 00:01:08,010
Speaker 1: And that goes from everything from logical thought, maybe asking, what is the game that I'm playing? 

15
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:16,170
Speaker 1: If you're playing a game of chess to procedural thought, how do I excel at that game and how do I implement the functionality or instruct a computer to excel at that? 

16
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,440
Speaker 1: And that's kind of what we did with our apps, right? 

17
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,680
Speaker 1: We ask ourselves, what is SEO? 

18
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
Speaker 1: What is the the features? 

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:32,130
Speaker 1: What are the features we're trying to implement, understand what is our natural parks system kind of ranker trying to do, what are we trying to implement.

20
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:33,690
Speaker 1: And that started with frameworks. 

21
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:42,040
Speaker 1: It started with understanding what we didn't know and trying to figure out more about the things we wanted to, understanding what frameworks allowed us to do that thing and work best with Loms. 

22
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,520
Speaker 1: In some cases, that meant asking questions to our tools, to agent assistant to learn.

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:56,770
Speaker 1: So even when we were building, stuff broke and we kind of knew that going in, but we use checkpoints, we used versioning to minimize the impact of what we're building. 

24
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,230
Speaker 1: And the really great thing is that agent and assistant came with those checkpoints, came with that version intro out of the box. 

25
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:09,460
Speaker 1: And so what that meant is that we could chunk up our builds into MVPs, minimum viable products and features, and move really quickly.

26
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,410
Speaker 1: Now, debugging, there is a good bit of debugging. 

27
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:22,370
Speaker 1: I think we had fun, but we were methodical, we were thorough, we understood how our apps worked, sometimes asking assistant, and we got to the root of the issues and fix our problems.

28
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:24,990
Speaker 1: Finally, context. 

29
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,030
Speaker 1: Obviously, context is important. 

30
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,110
Speaker 1: It's been something I've emphasized throughout the course. 

31
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:46,960
Speaker 1: But we got at context by providing images, providing links to what we were building, and in one case, providing actual data to a web page because we provided context, because we gave a thorough explanation to agent of what we were trying to do, it's actually able to extract that data and implement it into our application. 

32
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:54,420
Speaker 1: When agent made a mistake with implementing our database, we provided additional context, that is additional details about our app in order to get around it. 

33
00:02:54,820 --> 00:03:00,190
Speaker 1: So remember, always think about the context that you're supplying or not supplying to your LA.

34
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,500
Speaker 1: And finally, we used our framework for iterative building, iterative vibe coding. 

35
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:18,470
Speaker 1: If you want to call it that, for creating features with AI, testing those features, getting at an error or maybe not an error at all, debugging that error to get to a checkpoint and then moving on to the next feature. 

36
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:21,250
Speaker 1: And along the way, we built two applications that worked. 

37
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:27,190
Speaker 1: But if you follow this pattern, you'll be able to build much more advanced applications and much cooler things. 

38
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,230
Speaker 1: So what are some next steps if you're new to vibe coding or this is the start of your journey?

39
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:33,830
Speaker 1: I think the biggest step is to just keep building. 

40
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:40,870
Speaker 1: I found that I Learned best by doing, and I would encourage you to keep doing the same and most importantly, keep having fun. 

41
00:03:41,770 --> 00:03:50,930
Speaker 1: I do this by finding common problems in my life or finding things that I want to try to automate or recreate or improve and then implementing the skills that we just did together.

42
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,680
Speaker 1: Second, you can follow along on social. 

43
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,680
Speaker 1: You can connect with replied, you can connect with me. 

44
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,880
Speaker 1: I would love to see the things that you build and showcase them on our reply accounts. 

45
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,860
Speaker 1: And finally, if you're a Reply Core member, we do have a reply community. 

46
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:11,730
Speaker 1: So once you join core, you'll be eligible to join our community where you can post and interact with other members. 

47
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,550
Speaker 1: But again, I'm Matt in Developer relations with replied. 

48
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:19,740
Speaker 1: This has been 5 coding 1:01 on replied. Thanks for joining.
