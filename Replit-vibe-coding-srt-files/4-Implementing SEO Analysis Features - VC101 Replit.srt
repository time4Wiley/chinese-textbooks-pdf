1
00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:05,400
Speaker 1: Now we'll enhance our search engine optimization or SEO analyzer prototype. 

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:10,710
Speaker 1: We'll use agent to add core functionality, then switch to assistant for customization and feature expansion. 

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:14,860
Speaker 1: Finally, we'll deploy our application so others can access it online.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,300
Speaker 1: Now let's get back to it. 

5
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:23,330
Speaker 1: So in this lesson, we're going to enhance the functionality of our application and start adding a lot of polish to exactly what we've built. 

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:34,490
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna go ahead to the top and create a new chat with agent to clear out the context like we discuss and start off by saying that we want to make a more visually appealing and visually representative app.

7
00:00:34,570 --> 00:00:42,520
Speaker 1: We have all this data about our website, about the tags that we've built, but the only real visual summary that we're getting is an overall SEO score. 

8
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:57,690
Speaker 1: So I'm wondering if we could get something that more better captures the entirety of this, these tags, maybe something that tells us if our images, a summary of our images, a summary of our titles and descriptions, as well as this kind of high level information. 

9
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:02,450
Speaker 1: So what we're gonna do is we're going to consolidate that into a prompt and ask agent. 

10
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:06,090
Speaker 1: We're also gonna ask again for a little bit more polish on the UI. 

11
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:11,250
Speaker 1: So what I'm gonna say here is make the application more visual. 

12
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:19,270
Speaker 1: So I'm starting high level and then I'm gonna drill down with just some quick bullet points for agent that are all kind of feeding into the same functionality.

13
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,470
Speaker 1: Again, we're keeping these very targeted. 

14
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:24,150
Speaker 1: We're not getting too crazy with what we're doing in one prompt. 

15
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:42,010
Speaker 1: So create summaries for each category of meta tag that you will display visually to the user, similar to the overall score. 

16
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:51,180
Speaker 1: If you remember from our wireframe, right, I had in mind this concept of multiple scores that we could inspire effect each kind of category in our website. 

17
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:56,100
Speaker 1: And it's okay that, you know, our MVP, what we're building here doesn't look exactly like my wireframe. 

18
00:01:56,140 --> 00:02:00,260
Speaker 1: The wireframe is really more just to guide what we're building and keep that in the front of my mind. 

19
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:04,230
Speaker 1: But I am gonna drill down here and try to tune those things in a little bit more. 

20
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:20,130
Speaker 1: Make the app overall more visual and allow me to get a summary of the SEO results at a glance. 

21
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:24,460
Speaker 1: So we'll add one more point, which is exactly that. 

22
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:33,250
Speaker 1: And you know, a lot of times I see when people are building with AI, they'll come to me and say, hey, Matt, I'm trying to get AI to do this thing because XYZ and I want ABC outcome, right? 

23
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:35,410
Speaker 1: And I'm like, just tell the model that. 

24
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:39,980
Speaker 1: So exactly what I just told you, we're gonna tell to agent help.

25
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:41,780
Speaker 1: Overall. 

26
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:53,050
Speaker 1: Let's make the app more visual and user friendly for folks that might be new to SEO. 

27
00:02:53,860 --> 00:03:02,360
Speaker 1: So we can get a high level view of how well our page is implemented.

28
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,200
Speaker 1: Now, it's kind of like, you know, giving wishes to a genie. 

29
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:11,640
Speaker 1: You know, if you're not very explicit, the Genie might just do some crazy stuff, right? 

30
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:18,900
Speaker 1: So what we have to do here, if we're asking for simplicity, is follow up that we want all the functionality that our app has right now. 

31
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,340
Speaker 1: We don't want you to take anything away. 

32
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:22,620
Speaker 1: So that's a very important thing that I've noticed as wonders. 

33
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:39,190
Speaker 1: Do not remove any functionality, just make it easier to see a high level summary or drill down into the details. 

34
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,020
Speaker 1: And I think we kind of know with the drill by now. 

35
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:44,260
Speaker 1: So we're just gonna let this one run. 

36
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:47,980
Speaker 1: We'll come back once agent is done implementing these features and we'll talk about what it did.

37
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:59,070
Speaker 1: Okay, so we're through that round of edits. 

38
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,190
Speaker 1: Let's see what we've gotten here. 

39
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,590
Speaker 1: We're just gonna go back with our old example. 

40
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:03,720
Speaker 1: We're gonna analyze that. 

41
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:09,320
Speaker 1: And now looks like we get a bit more of a visual representation of our checks. 

42
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:15,350
Speaker 1: There appears to be, let's see what's going on here, much better overview. 

43
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:19,630
Speaker 1: So we're generating kind of key findings and what's good, meta keywords, it's good. 

44
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:24,760
Speaker 1: These are present, what needs attention, as well as some priority recommendation. 

45
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,000
Speaker 1: So optimizing the title tag and improving the description. 

46
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,840
Speaker 1: We also get some category breakdown. 

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,440
Speaker 1: So SEO and social media optimization.

48
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:36,720
Speaker 1: So looks like there's some checks going on there. 

49
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:41,760
Speaker 1: It's checking both for titles and the way that things are gonna show up on social media. 

50
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,960
Speaker 1: We're checking how robots index our site. 

51
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:51,150
Speaker 1: What's known as a robot TXT typically determines how websites can be scraped on social media. 

52
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:54,630
Speaker 1: We also have open graph tags and Twitter card checks.

53
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:59,900
Speaker 1: Now we can still drill down into technical details and actually get a Google search. 

54
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,430
Speaker 1: Preview, which is nice. 

55
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:05,070
Speaker 1: So you can see like this is maybe a little too simple for Google. 

56
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,420
Speaker 1: Well, as our social media previews. 

57
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:12,260
Speaker 1: And this is a bit more clean, nicer display, both for Facebook and Twitter. 

58
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:19,810
Speaker 1: And then if we want to drop down into our SEO recommendations, we get a much more descriptive view here. 

59
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:21,250
Speaker 1: We can still see our raw tags. 

60
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:22,650
Speaker 1: There's also some like nice hover effect. 

61
00:05:23,650 --> 00:05:25,840
Speaker 1: So, you know, this is like 3 or four prompts.

62
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,400
Speaker 1: But what I want to point out is that more than anything, we had attention to detail and we had attention to exactly what we wanted changed. 

63
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:34,180
Speaker 1: And so we drilled into our app. 

64
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:36,070
Speaker 1: There's still some things that aren't perfect, right? 

65
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:37,670
Speaker 1: Like this is not ideal. 

66
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:42,230
Speaker 1: The spacing here, we could really kind of like  out with getting this to look the way we want to. 

67
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:45,610
Speaker 1: But overall, we have something that's fundamentally more polished.

68
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:52,890
Speaker 1: Now, there were still a couple points, so we're gonna open up assistant here to make some like finer grain changes to what we just built. 

69
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,870
Speaker 1: And when you open up assistant, you might notice that your app resupport darts, you might notice that there's a refresh. 

70
00:05:58,870 --> 00:06:02,230
Speaker 1: And that's because we're kind of like leaving agent mode, so to speak. 

71
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:07,180
Speaker 1: And if you remember, I didn't really like that I couldn't type in that. 

72
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,740
Speaker 1: I had to type in https. 

73
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:35,750
Speaker 1: So what I'm gonna say to assistant, because it actually has a lot of the same context, right, into our application that agent has, I'm gonna say, can you make the website entry form such that https is automatically populated and the user doesn't have to enter any other info. 

74
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:43,240
Speaker 1: And because this is a quicker tool, assistance is more lightweight tool, you're gonna notice that the responses are much quicker. 

75
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,640
Speaker 1: And so assistant is going to read the relevant files.

76
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,400
Speaker 1: This is our first kind of intro to assistant. 

77
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,250
Speaker 1: It's behaving a lot like agent, but in a similar manner. 

78
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:55,360
Speaker 1: It's going to make the change and then it's gonna make a checkpoint. 

79
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,360
Speaker 1: So we made a checkpoint. 

80
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,920
Speaker 1: Https is prefixed theoretically, or we'll do deep learning this time. 

81
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:06,380
Speaker 1: Deep learning, we just type in deep learning AI, we get our result. 

82
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:15,120
Speaker 1: So what you might notice is that our sort of globe element is on top of the https to provide context for assistant. 

83
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 1: I'm gonna actually open up our screenshot tool here. 

84
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,240
Speaker 1: This is just using Mac OS. 

85
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,920
Speaker 1: So if you're on Windows, might be different. 

86
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:32,100
Speaker 1: I'm gonna copy this to my clipboard and then I'm gonna paste that screenshot in and say, now the globe iverlaps with https. 

87
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:33,820
Speaker 1: Can you fix it?

88
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:40,610
Speaker 1: When we talked about context, right, we talked about providing additional details to AI, giving it the information it needs to fix errors. 

89
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:41,330
Speaker 1: And that's what we're doing here. 

90
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:49,690
Speaker 1: Hey, now assistant can see the overlapping problem and it's gonna present us with a solution and ask if we wanna apply those changes. 

91
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:51,810
Speaker 1: Looks like we're getting a bit of an error here. 

92
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,450
Speaker 1: Let's preview and see what's happening. 

93
00:07:54,050 --> 00:08:00,090
Speaker 1: It's actually just removing, it looks like removing the globe here, but the commit didn't quite work. 

94
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,400
Speaker 1: That's okay. 

95
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
Speaker 1: We're actually, you know, sometimes stuff like that happens, you might get similar errors. 

96
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,620
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna literally paste this in, may copy this, come around again, I'll see what happens. 

97
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,870
Speaker 1: So it looks like it just took another command really quick to run through. 

98
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:19,670
Speaker 1: It actually looks like the original changes were applied. 

99
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:24,910
Speaker 1: We just might have gotten a bit of a rerun, getting a little air there. 

100
00:08:24,950 --> 00:08:25,550
Speaker 1: It's all good. 

101
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,700
Speaker 1: And when a system makes a new checkpoint, it's gonna restart our app.

102
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,900
Speaker 1: So now we have our app, we have the https. 

103
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,800
Speaker 1: I can just type in deep learning AI and click analyze. 

104
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,050
Speaker 1: Just like that. 

105
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,130
Speaker 1: We flipped over to assistant. 

106
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:38,690
Speaker 1: We made some more lightweight details. 

107
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:41,730
Speaker 1: This is kind of like what we wanted to build for our application. 

108
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:44,400
Speaker 1: So we're gonna walk through the deploy pattern. 

109
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,720
Speaker 1: This is something we'll do for both of our applications. 

110
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,640
Speaker 1: Note that deployments are limited to replicate core users. 

111
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,440
Speaker 1: So you might not see this experience. 

112
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:55,510
Speaker 1: But at any time, if you wanna subscribe or upgrade, you can deploy that way. 

113
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:59,970
Speaker 1: Clicking deploy, we're actually just gonna configure the build for you. 

114
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:05,160
Speaker 1: You don't really need to worry about these details or really even what auto scale means. 

115
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:09,700
Speaker 1: We're gonna approve and configure the settings and then we're gonna come up with a name per app. 

116
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,540
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna call my SEO tag inspector.

117
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,240
Speaker 1: Note that we're configuring the build command and the run command. 

118
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,160
Speaker 1: I don't really need to worry about any of this. 

119
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,480
Speaker 1: Agent's gonna take care of it for me. 

120
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:19,900
Speaker 1: Alright, click to play. 

121
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:23,220
Speaker 1: And you know, it's important to mention what's going on.

122
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,940
Speaker 1: This typically takes two or three minutes. 

123
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:32,560
Speaker 1: We're taking this application, we're bundling it up, we're taking this entire environment that we've built with agent and then we're just putting that on the cloud. 

124
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,210
Speaker 1: Basically, you don't really have to worry about the technical complexity of what's going on. 

125
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:39,400
Speaker 1: You don't have to worry about any of the nuance or details. 

126
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:45,050
Speaker 1: What you do have to know is that everything that you just build, we'll look the same on the web page that we're deploying.

127
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:46,220
Speaker 1: Now. 

128
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:51,520
Speaker 1: If you went back and made more changes, this application, they will not automatically flow through. 

129
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,400
Speaker 1: You'd have to go through and click redeploy. 

130
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:59,920
Speaker 1: So we're going a little bit slower in this lesson, but that's because we want to cover all the basics and understand how things work. 

131
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:12,690
Speaker 1: So when we build our application, when we click deploy, we're taking a snapshot of everything that we just built with agent, with assistant, all these features that we added, and then promoting them to their own web page, which we just defined.

132
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:26,420
Speaker 1: If at any time you want to learn more about the different types of deployments that we have or how deployments work or any of the technical details, you can learn more in our documentation or check out some videos on YouTube that I built that have some really in depth content. 

133
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:35,010
Speaker 1: But at a high level, we're gonna select the right deployment type for you and we can be very confident that's the right type to deploy. 

134
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:37,490
Speaker 1: So in the meantime, you can watch this cool loading screen. 

135
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:41,810
Speaker 1: All deployments also come with logs so you can see exactly what's happening in your deployment. 

136
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:50,330
Speaker 1: They come with analytics, so you'll be able to see who's visiting your deployment, how many users you have as well as some other settings that you can drill into. 

137
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:53,770
Speaker 1: Those will be visible once our deployment is done. 

138
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,600
Speaker 1: In the meantime, we're gonna sit back. 

139
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,760
Speaker 1: I'll join you once this is done to point. 

140
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,570
Speaker 1: So we're back. 

141
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,330
Speaker 1: You can see the deployment took about two minutes, which is great. 

142
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,980
Speaker 1: And we're gonna give you the domain you just deploy to. 

143
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,650
Speaker 1: So if I go to this URL, we're gonna get the same app.

144
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,210
Speaker 1: This is now deployed on the internet. 

145
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,490
Speaker 1: Note it's at its own URL. 

146
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:12,850
Speaker 1: You can visit this site if you want. 

147
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:18,650
Speaker 1: I actually just entered a site and it had https and the form automatically removed that format. 

148
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:19,490
Speaker 1: So that's really nice. 

149
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:20,850
Speaker 1: Can click analyze. 

150
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:23,850
Speaker 1: It's gonna work exactly the same as what we had before.

151
00:11:24,590 --> 00:11:25,950
Speaker 1: So these are the basics. 

152
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:40,490
Speaker 1: We just built end to end an application with agent, with assistant that scrapes web pages, performs an analysis on that web page to tell us if there's anything that we can prove or maybe optimize for SEO, Google results or social posts and then deployed it. 

153
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:42,290
Speaker 1: We built a tool completely there. 

154
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,890
Speaker 1: Other people can use that you can use. 

155
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:45,770
Speaker 1: And that's how simple it is. 

156
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:50,650
Speaker 1: And so this lesson was really more about polishing, flipping over to assistant. 

157
00:11:50,730 --> 00:11:56,330
Speaker 1: In the next lesson, we'll be able to speed through a bit more of the basics since we've already covered those and get into more of a complex topic. 

158
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:59,920
Speaker 1: So I'm really excited for that one. I'll catch you in the. 

159
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Speaker 1: max lesson。
