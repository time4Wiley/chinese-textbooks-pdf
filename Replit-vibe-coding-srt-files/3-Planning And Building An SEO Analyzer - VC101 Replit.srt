1
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:04,060
Speaker 1: In this lesson, we'll build a website performance analyzer. 

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:07,420
Speaker 1: You'll learn how to examine HTML content and understand website structure. 

3
00:00:07,830 --> 00:00:10,350
Speaker 1: That is understanding the concepts that we'll be automating. 

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:17,160
Speaker 1: We'll create a product requirements document or PRD and wireframe before leveraging replets agent to build our first prototype.

5
00:00:17,690 --> 00:00:23,970
Speaker 1: So as we just covered, we're going to build an SEO analyzer where you can enter any website URL and view the site's load times and tax. 

6
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:28,820
Speaker 1: We'll also cover exactly what these things are and exactly why they're important. 

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,910
Speaker 1: That allows us to check if the websites properly implemented and get insights on SEO best practices.

8
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:40,230
Speaker 1: So when we talk about building a PRD or building a wireframe, this is what we're talking about. 

9
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,910
Speaker 1: And so we're gonna walk through exactly what I have in front of me. 

10
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,670
Speaker 1: This is using an online whiteboarding tool. 

11
00:00:44,890 --> 00:01:01,500
Speaker 1: And why I think it's important, it's an interactive tool that allows you to enter a website URL, view a visual representation of the site's load times and tags to make sure what we're building is properly configured and check if the site is properly implemented as a stretch goal, we might store recently analyze sites in a database. 

12
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:08,650
Speaker 1: And the skills involved here are prompting, processing and analyzing HTML content and creating intuitive data visualizations. 

13
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:13,160
Speaker 1: It also involves handling errors and edge cases, as well as storage.

14
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:24,400
Speaker 1: So on the left, I took some time to sketch up a mock of what we're gonna build, the main entry point that users will engage with is a simple text box where you can enter a URL. 

15
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:30,030
Speaker 1: From entering that URL, we want our app to return recommendations on the website that we enter. 

16
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:34,070
Speaker 1: For example, hey, you didn't give a title to your website or you didn't give a description to your website. 

17
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:38,910
Speaker 1: And that's gonna make it hard for Google to find your website or hard for people to know what your website's about. 

18
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,830
Speaker 1: And these meta tags are embedded on every website. 

19
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:46,560
Speaker 1: And so when you're building websites or when you're deploying apps, it's actually important to consider these things. 

20
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:53,240
Speaker 1: It's important to consider the preview of how your website shows up when people search for it, and that's what our app is going to allow us to do.

21
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,120
Speaker 1: It's going to allow us to analyze any website and access this information. 

22
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:05,860
Speaker 1: So when we talk about vibe coding or just going with the flow, it can often be more helpful to go through this exercise and break down exactly what we want. 

23
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:16,240
Speaker 1: Conceptualize it, visualize it, so that we're not going into a tool without really any concept of what we're doing, where we understand at least a little bit better what we're trying to get to.

24
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,310
Speaker 1: So let's talk about how this flows into an initial prompt for replied agent. 

25
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:30,860
Speaker 1: So my prompt here is help me create an interactive app that displays the SEO or meta tags for any website in an interactive and visual way to check that they're properly implemented. 

26
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,900
Speaker 1: Note in this first sentence that this is domain specific knowledge. 

27
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:35,910
Speaker 1: You might not know what SEO tags are. 

28
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:37,390
Speaker 1: You might not know what meta tags are. 

29
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:44,840
Speaker 1: AI does and by using those terms, by kind of understanding the framework or understanding what we might not know about this domain. 

30
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,140
Speaker 1: We're able to target and direct the agent into what it's building.

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,640
Speaker 1: The next part of our prompt, the app should fetch the HTML first site, then provide feedback on SEO tags. 

32
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:00,970
Speaker 1: In accordance with best practices for SEO optimization, the app should give Google and social media previous.

33
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:10,030
Speaker 1: Now that last point I think is just important because I've done some work with SEO optimization and that's something I wanted to visualize specifically because it can be very visual. 

34
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,940
Speaker 1: But note that we're asking the app to fetch the HTML for the site. 

35
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,420
Speaker 1: That's essentially scraping websites. 

36
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:21,390
Speaker 1: So what we're doing is for any website, we're gonna scrape it and then we're gonna get the contents of this thing. 

37
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,670
Speaker 1: And we want our app to return feedback, right? 

38
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,110
Speaker 1: We want actionable insights on the thing that we're doing. 

39
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:31,850
Speaker 1: And so we're thinking through the language and the phrasing that we can provide to agent to get those results.

40
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:36,180
Speaker 1: It's important to note, right, that I know SEO tags are embedded in the HTML of a site. 

41
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,760
Speaker 1: Anyone can access them. 

42
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,520
Speaker 1: And that's how I know that this app has a high likelihood of working and succeeding. 

43
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:54,490
Speaker 1: And just as a very clear visual representation of what we're building, when we search deep learning on Google, the result that we're returning is actually the SEO title of the website and the description is listed below.

44
00:03:54,890 --> 00:04:00,090
Speaker 1: And so we can see this in the console or the actual underlying HTML of the page. 

45
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:06,960
Speaker 1: And so if I click into the page and then I right click and click inspect, we're gonna get what's known as a browser console. 

46
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:10,740
Speaker 1: This actually lets us do some pretty cool stuff, or rather dev tools. 

47
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,290
Speaker 1: So if I click into the page, right, click there and inspect, I'm gonna access our dev tools.

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,760
Speaker 1: And this might look a little scary. 

49
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,120
Speaker 1: This is just the underlying HTML for the website. 

50
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:25,390
Speaker 1: Now, if you go into the HTML head section, you're gonna see a whole bunch of stuff. 

51
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,090
Speaker 1: You can see actually things called meta tags. 

52
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:38,320
Speaker 1: And one of those is the title deep on AI, start or advance your career in AI, as well as the description, join over 7 million people learning how to use and build AI through our online courses. 

53
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:43,960
Speaker 1: These are the tags that we're going to extract to understand if our websites properly implemented. 

54
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:45,610
Speaker 1: So we've talked about our prompt. 

55
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,410
Speaker 1: We've gone over our wireframe and our PID. 

56
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:50,890
Speaker 1: We're gonna type in our prompt and just click start building on replied. 

57
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:54,740
Speaker 1: Now we're gonna see some things start happening. 

58
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,830
Speaker 1: I'm gonna walk through this because it's our first course and discuss how agent builds these applica.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:00,550
Speaker 1: Patients. 

60
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:05,320
Speaker 1: Fundamentally agents different from other types of vibe coding apps because agent produces a plan. 

61
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:14,910
Speaker 1: The plan is going to help us understand what we're building and confirm that we're taking the right actions or we're moving kind of closer to what we actually want. 

62
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:24,730
Speaker 1: So agent is going to analyze that prompt and present a plan to us, says it's gonna build the initial prototype and ask if it wants, if we want any follow up features in the initial prototype. 

63
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:28,410
Speaker 1: It'll also mention if it's using any frameworks or integrations. 

64
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,180
Speaker 1: I'm gonna approve this plan and start and then talk a little bit more about that. 

65
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:36,090
Speaker 1: So it's important to mention that agent does come with a ton of integration. 

66
00:05:36,090 --> 00:05:43,240
Speaker 1: Sophie said, for example, build me an app that uses the Anthropic API or build me an app that has straight payments. 

67
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:46,920
Speaker 1: We support those integrations natively and agent should mention that in the app.

68
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:53,260
Speaker 1: Now what's happening on the right is that in real time, agent is designing a visual preview of our app. 

69
00:05:53,870 --> 00:06:01,410
Speaker 1: And the goal there is to get you something that you can use as fast as possible or something that you can visualize rather as fast as possible. 

70
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:04,950
Speaker 1: But it's important to note this is not the actual application. 

71
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:08,470
Speaker 1: And so we can see, you know, kind of closer to our wireframe. 

72
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:11,190
Speaker 1: Okay, the main entry point is just this website URL. 

73
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:13,310
Speaker 1: And from there, we're gonna be able to analyze it.

74
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:21,890
Speaker 1: Now, once the agent is done with that visual preview that actually is mentioning to us up here, it's creating a fully interactive version of our app. 

75
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:29,470
Speaker 1: And so underneath the hood, agent is scaffolding this project, installing packages, configuring your environment. 

76
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:30,920
Speaker 1: And this is what we talked about at the beginning, right? 

77
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:33,480
Speaker 1: Replied is more than just agent and assistant. 

78
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:36,080
Speaker 1: It's actually an entire environment and an entire workspace. 

79
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:39,080
Speaker 1: So while we're getting this set up, I'm gonna walk through the workspace. 

80
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:43,680
Speaker 1: If you go over here, up in the top left, you can take a look at the files that exist in the workspace. 

81
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:52,480
Speaker 1: And as agent continues building, these are gonna be populated with the folders and the directories that the project contains, right? 

82
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:58,540
Speaker 1: And so it's important really, again to drive home that this is an entire interactive workspace in the cloud at any time. 

83
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:04,730
Speaker 1: If you're familiar with programming concepts, if you wanna open something like a shell or a console, you can do that. 

84
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,450
Speaker 1: And we have access to that now. 

85
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:09,410
Speaker 1: You also don't have to do these things if you're not familiar with programming. 

86
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:12,100
Speaker 1: We're gonna build entirely using natural language. 

87
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:30,840
Speaker 1: But it is important to mention that through this new tab interface up top, or the All tools section on the left hand side, you can access all of the services and tools available in the workspace, which include things like integrating Git, installing dependencies, viewing our output, will go over exactly what that is. 

88
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:39,440
Speaker 1: Storing secrets are basically a very secure way to store environment variables that require no configuration and many more things.

89
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:46,690
Speaker 1: But going back to our app, agent is still working on the fully functional version, which might take five to 10 minutes. 

90
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:49,730
Speaker 1: And so that's another important thing to call out as we're building this application. 

91
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:55,050
Speaker 1: The way agent is designed is to build these apps from sort of start to MVP. 

92
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,130
Speaker 1: And that's why we stayed high level and we're keeping the prompt simple. 

93
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:02,040
Speaker 1: These runs could take two minutes, it could take five or 10 minutes. 

94
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,970
Speaker 1: But for the first implementation, you can expect a fully featured app. 

95
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:13,600
Speaker 1: As you can see on the left there, agent just created a client, a server, and a whole host of other configuration files. 

96
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:19,390
Speaker 1: Now we see the agent is actually writing and creating files in this interactive ping here. 

97
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:27,550
Speaker 1: And part of the reason that we do this is because we want to get you to an MVP as fast as possible, and so there's less back and forth required with replied agent. 

98
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:31,890
Speaker 1: But along the way, agent is gonna show you exactly what it's doing. 

99
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:35,410
Speaker 1: So we can see that it's writing this file server routes. 

100
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:39,070
Speaker 1: It already wrote our client index and some other things.

101
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:53,310
Speaker 1: Now it's not important to dig into how all of these things work, but what might be useful is to start to pay attention to how agent creates these apps and start to reverse engineer how the applications work because it can teach you a lot about programming. 

102
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:55,030
Speaker 1: It can teach you a lot about building. 

103
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:59,840
Speaker 1: For example, I see that there are folders here, client, server, and shared. 

104
00:09:00,390 --> 00:09:03,950
Speaker 1: If you're unfamiliar, a client is typically a front end and a server is typically a backend. 

105
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,620
Speaker 1: So it makes sense that clicking to the server exposes things like routes. 

106
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,300
Speaker 1: If you're not familiar with APIs, this is a way, a programmatic way for applications to communicate. 

107
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,590
Speaker 1: And that happens in our backend. 

108
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Speaker 1: But in the client, we might see the source file and notice there's like an index. 

109
00:09:20,140 --> 00:09:29,440
Speaker 1: HTML file, things like app dot TSX, that might be a main sort of entry point for our app or index dot CSS defines how the app is style. 

110
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:33,880
Speaker 1: And so what I'm trying to drive home here is that you really don't need to look at any of this. 

111
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,640
Speaker 1: You know, like if this is intimidating for you, just close that and don't look at it. 

112
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,320
Speaker 1: And, you know, like we'll just keep vibe coding. 

113
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:46,300
Speaker 1: But if you're trying to learn and follow along as you're building these things, you can start to poke around, start to pay attention.

114
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:50,660
Speaker 1: Oh, hey, agent is defining this thing, this component called Social Media Preview. 

115
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:59,660
Speaker 1: I bet if we go into our components folder and we look at the stuff that's in here, the Google preview probably defines something. 

116
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,990
Speaker 1: That would show us a preview of what it might look like on Google. 

117
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:11,660
Speaker 1: So again, agent is going to, on the first run, create this app from scratch, is going to implement the front end and the backend.

118
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:18,550
Speaker 1: This is a lot of talking, yes, but what we're going to have when agent is done running is an MVP that we can start iterating on. 

119
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:28,100
Speaker 1: It does that in order to deliver you something that just works and that we can kind of keep punching through or we can keep iterating on once our application is stood up. 

120
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:32,020
Speaker 1: And so that's been our workspace overview. 

121
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,820
Speaker 1: We're gonna let the agent keep building. 

122
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,180
Speaker 1: You'll be able to see all of the things that it does. 

123
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,230
Speaker 1: And then we'll come back once we have our MVP and start iterating. 

124
00:10:40,350 --> 00:10:44,150
Speaker 1: This is often how I develop my first prototypes when I'm building with Rebel Agent.

125
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:50,960
Speaker 1: Cool. 

126
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,760
Speaker 1: So what she'll notice on the right is that we have a implemented version of our app. 

127
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:00,770
Speaker 1: And I wanna dig in for a second to the agent sort of history, chat history here to see what was happening. 

128
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:06,170
Speaker 1: So as you saw, when we were writing the application, there are a bunch of file edits that happened. 

129
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:12,200
Speaker 1: And anytime you can dig into these and you can even click the drop down to see exactly what was created or exactly what changed.

130
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:21,620
Speaker 1: Then agent went along and actually installed the dependencies that we needed for our application as well as some ancillary dependencies that I might have missed on the first class pass. 

131
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:29,510
Speaker 1: Then it configured the run button up top here to execute our app and cycle through and actually recognize, hey, we missed a package. 

132
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:31,830
Speaker 1: Like this thing is not gonna work unless we install it. 

133
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:40,110
Speaker 1: Then I did some final checks, made an edit to our storage implementation, noticed an issue, restarted the application and fix that issue. 

134
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,820
Speaker 1: And so one of the great things about building with rep, with reply, building with agent is that you don't have to worry about like some of these like hassles and getting started. 

135
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:52,210
Speaker 1: You can let agent take the reins and kind of implement some of this functionality from there. 

136
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:56,010
Speaker 1: It confirmed exactly what it did and exactly what it created.

137
00:11:56,050 --> 00:11:58,730
Speaker 1: Now, this is another good way to learn about what we're building. 

138
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:02,410
Speaker 1: Hey, we created a complete data model for storing and analyzing these tags. 

139
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,010
Speaker 1: We built backend API endpoints. 

140
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:07,890
Speaker 1: We implement our front end with a URL input, results overview, and visualization. 

141
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,420
Speaker 1: And we did a bunch other stuff. 

142
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,540
Speaker 1: So now we can see if it works. 

143
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,420
Speaker 1: We can start debugging. 

144
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,540
Speaker 1: We can start testing our app. 

145
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:17,660
Speaker 1: We have our web view on the right, which is gonna show us a preview of our app.

146
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:27,220
Speaker 1: Now, what's important to note, if you've ever written code, if you've ever built with another tool, you've probably did that on local host, which is basically running something on your local machine.

147
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:34,170
Speaker 1: This web view is gonna look similar, but fundamentally this app, this replied app is running at a URL. 

148
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,150
Speaker 1: So you can actually access this from anywhere. 

149
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:38,030
Speaker 1: You can access it in your browser. 

150
00:12:38,030 --> 00:12:41,310
Speaker 1: If I click this and 0, it would open this web view up in a new tab. 

151
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:47,300
Speaker 1: You could scan it and access it on your phone in real time as you're developing, your friends could access it while you're building. 

152
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,420
Speaker 1: It's important to mention that once you leave this app, once you close this page, this URL will go to sleep. 

153
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:57,930
Speaker 1: This is not a deployment, but it is a development environment that is live on the internet technically. 

154
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:00,770
Speaker 1: So fundamentally, we're working with like a real web page. 

155
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,050
Speaker 1: So let's test this out. 

156
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:02,850
Speaker 1: Let's see how it works. 

157
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:07,610
Speaker 1: I'm gonna type in my blog and see what's going on. 

158
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,680
Speaker 1: So if I click analyze, we get an SEO summary, 86 out of 100. 

159
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:13,480
Speaker 1: I guess that's not bad. 

160
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,280
Speaker 1: It might be like a B+. 

161
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:16,690
Speaker 1: I'm not complaining. 

162
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:19,930
Speaker 1: It seems like we have some scores. 

163
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:21,090
Speaker 1: Let's see what's going on here. 

164
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,330
Speaker 1: So Matt Palmer. 

165
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:22,810
Speaker 1: That's right. 

166
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,290
Speaker 1: Developer marketing simplified. 

167
00:13:24,290 --> 00:13:24,770
Speaker 1: That's right. 

168
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,060
Speaker 1: It looks like a warning. 

169
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,660
Speaker 1: Our title tag is too short a description. 

170
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,140
Speaker 1: The description is a bit too short. 

171
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,740
Speaker 1: The details there. 

172
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:33,840
Speaker 1: Looks like we're getting some best practices. 

173
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:35,560
Speaker 1: So this is pretty similar to what we wanted. 

174
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,080
Speaker 1: And we also have some keywords, recommendations. 

175
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:43,010
Speaker 1: We're getting a kind of a pass there and some other recommendations. 

176
00:13:43,010 --> 00:13:53,790
Speaker 1: So what our analyzer is telling us is, hey, if we want our website to show up on search on Google, maybe even an indexing for LLMs, I don't know, we could optimize our title. 

177
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,110
Speaker 1: We could improve the description and make it maybe a little bit longer. 

178
00:13:57,590 --> 00:13:58,590
Speaker 1: So this is really great. 

179
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:01,140
Speaker 1: I'd say it's close to what we want. 

180
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,940
Speaker 1: It looks like we also have some social media previews. 

181
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,220
Speaker 1: So let's go see what's going on there. 

182
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:09,730
Speaker 1: So we have a Facebook preview and it is loading the image properly. 

183
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,840
Speaker 1: And we have a Twitter preview and it's also loading image properly there. 

184
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:26,030
Speaker 1: So what we've done here is implemented this tool that they can then check to make sure that our website is displayed properly on social media and that it's being indexed properly by SEO. 

185
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,030
Speaker 1: And this was one shot, right? 

186
00:14:27,030 --> 00:14:29,070
Speaker 1: We all we did was type in that initial prompt.

187
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,630
Speaker 1: Let's try with another website. 

188
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:36,490
Speaker 1: Let's say deep learning dot AI, see what we can. 

189
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,640
Speaker 1: Okay, so I just wanna point out my website had a higher score. 

190
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,000
Speaker 1: I'm sure after I record this, Andrew's website will have a higher score. 

191
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:45,890
Speaker 1: I have no doubt he's gonna be on top of that. 

192
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:54,280
Speaker 1: But just to see that everything's coming through, we do get our social media previews and we do get our Twitter card previews and everything else. 

193
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,320
Speaker 1: So this is kind of the part we're talking about, right? 

194
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:57,480
Speaker 1: Like now I'm just testing the app. 

195
00:14:57,600 --> 00:14:59,640
Speaker 1: I'm seeing if it does what I expect it to do.

196
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:06,950
Speaker 1: Part of vibe coding, a large part of vibe coding is having an attention to detail and having a really like dialed in product sense. 

197
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,780
Speaker 1: For example, I'm not crazy about the spacing here.

198
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,860
Speaker 1: 83 looks like it's on top of 100. 

199
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,740
Speaker 1: That's like not good enough. 

200
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,460
Speaker 1: We're gonna fix that. 

201
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,300
Speaker 1: We're gonna make that better. 

202
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:17,950
Speaker 1: Some of the other elements down here, this looks nice, but these are mislined. 

203
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:19,950
Speaker 1: Past isn't in the middle of this pill. 

204
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:35,950
Speaker 1: I think a lot of the other sort of visual representations of this site are really good, but part of building with AI is being very descriptive about what works, about what doesn't work, and about what you want to change, right? 

205
00:15:35,950 --> 00:15:42,370
Speaker 1: And so another example, this, the padding could, there could probably be more padding on this website for it to look nice.

206
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:46,980
Speaker 1: One of the interesting things about web development is that you want your apps to be responsive. 

207
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:50,460
Speaker 1: So you can see there, if we make this wider, the padding actually looks a little bit better. 

208
00:15:50,730 --> 00:15:54,640
Speaker 1: So what's going on here is probably that this isn't optimized for small screens. 

209
00:15:54,760 --> 00:16:00,900
Speaker 1: We can see that by resizing the web view or by going to this handy little screen size toggle here and seeing what it looks like on an iPhone. 

210
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,840
Speaker 1: Maybe we wanna build this for an iPhone. 

211
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,680
Speaker 1: So it's important to check that out, right? 

212
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:09,080
Speaker 1: Like, hey, these pills, they're not really expanding the way I want them to. 

213
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,390
Speaker 1: These tabs, they might look a little compress. 

214
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:13,870
Speaker 1: So the icons might not be align properly. 

215
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,230
Speaker 1: And then we don't get the same aspect ratio for these images. 

216
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,520
Speaker 1: Again, this might seem trivial, but it's really important to dig into the details, right? 

217
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,080
Speaker 1: The text is overlapping here. 

218
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:30,770
Speaker 1: So all that considered, we have an MVP, we have something that works, and I think it's pretty impressive that agent did in one shot. 

219
00:16:30,770 --> 00:16:34,790
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna follow up and we're gonna fix some of these characteristics. 

220
00:16:34,830 --> 00:16:38,930
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna say make my app fully responsive. 

221
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:40,810
Speaker 1: This prompt is important. 

222
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,210
Speaker 1: What is responsive mean? 

223
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:48,730
Speaker 1: Well, what it actually means in web development is that your app responds to resizing the screen, right? 

224
00:16:48,810 --> 00:16:50,610
Speaker 1: And so that will make it mobile friendly. 

225
00:16:51,010 --> 00:17:02,450
Speaker 1: And so saying, Mike, my app fully responsive and mobile friendly, we're using key terms that are synonymous with web development techniques that AI is gonna understand and implement pretty well. 

226
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:16,250
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna say make my app fully responsive and mobile friendly and fix some of the alignment and padding issues with the buttons and elements. 

227
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:32,730
Speaker 1: Specifically fix the centering of the overall SEO score and remove the slash 100 being very descriptive about what I want edited here.

228
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,580
Speaker 1: You might notice I'm asking for a couple things. 

229
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:46,490
Speaker 1: As we talked about, we want these edits to be concise, but in my experience building with AI, we can do something like, hey, I wanna make the app responsive and mobile friendly and I wanna fix some of this other stuff. 

230
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,730
Speaker 1: And then we can hit enter and run that with agent. 

231
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:51,820
Speaker 1: Again, we're gonna kick off an agent run. 

232
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:56,720
Speaker 1: I think you can expect this one to go a little bit faster, given that their smaller edits. 

233
00:17:56,970 --> 00:18:02,690
Speaker 1: I'm gonna talk a little bit about what we're doing here and then we'll let this finish up and jump back once it's done.

234
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:14,030
Speaker 1: Again, building with AI vibe coding, it's like asking a junior developer or someone who's never seen your project before to make changes. 

235
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:18,750
Speaker 1: You have to be really descriptive about what you want, make this fully responsive and mobile friendly. 

236
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:22,790
Speaker 1: Fix some of the alignment and padding issues, specifically this one that I'm seeing. 

237
00:18:23,550 --> 00:18:31,890
Speaker 1: And if you can do that, agent has all the tools to access the files and the context of your workspace to understand what the issues are and fix them. 

238
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:36,700
Speaker 1: So you can see, hey, I'm looking at the home component. 

239
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:46,670
Speaker 1: I'm editing the URL form in the client, and I'm gonna start updating the results overview to fix the SEO display and make it more responsive. 

240
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:53,450
Speaker 1: So just like that, we're targeting some of these edits and we can kind of hope, right, that this is gonna carry through and do what we want it to do. 

241
00:18:54,110 --> 00:19:00,920
Speaker 1: Another important thing to mention is like when we ask agent to do these things, it has all the context of these files in these directories. 

242
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:03,040
Speaker 1: And so it's gonna be able to search for files. 

243
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,880
Speaker 1: It's gonna be able to understand exactly what's going on. 

244
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:12,000
Speaker 1: A final point, these, and you can actually see in real time some of this stuff being updated, which is cool.

245
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,110
Speaker 1: What we're doing right now is we're in a chat with agent. 

246
00:19:16,150 --> 00:19:28,630
Speaker 1: And so when I talked about context, when I talked about talking to AI and telling it all of these different things, everything in this chat, in the agent's context window, it has the history of all these things that I've done. 

247
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:34,360
Speaker 1: As this starts to get longer, you might imagine AI being slower or being less responsive. 

248
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:43,800
Speaker 1: And so it's important when we're working on different things to create new chats, which will essentially clear the context or target the responses of agent. 

249
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:47,700
Speaker 1: And that's the same thing is true of assistant works in a very similar way.

250
00:19:47,780 --> 00:19:50,980
Speaker 1: So what we're doing is we're creating this initial chat. 

251
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,060
Speaker 1: We got to a prototype, and then we're iterating it on a little bit from there. 

252
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,340
Speaker 1: We're gonna switch to maybe a new chat for our next feature. 

253
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,900
Speaker 1: But that's all I wanted to talk about. We're gonna let this run. 

254
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:09,260
Speaker 1: And we'll jump back in once we have our results, so it looks like we're done with that run.

255
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:21,170
Speaker 1: Before we dig in, I just want to call out that you might see this V 2 early access, a little pill if you're taking this course relatively soon, we're working on our new revision of agent. 

256
00:20:21,170 --> 00:20:23,690
Speaker 1: By the time you're taking it, hopefully this is already out to everyone. 

257
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:24,850
Speaker 1: You might not see this. 

258
00:20:25,150 --> 00:20:30,510
Speaker 1: And you can just assume that you have the latest and greatest version of agent and that everything is gonna function the same way.

259
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,320
Speaker 1: Now, what we're seeing here is a very similar interface to what we just did. 

260
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:41,630
Speaker 1: And that's that agent made improvements to our app, kind of returned with a report of what it did, made some checkpoints along the way. 

261
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:43,960
Speaker 1: So notice how these checkpoints are free. 

262
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,840
Speaker 1: You should be seeing the same thing on your side. 

263
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:54,060
Speaker 1: And fix the SEO score display, improve the mobile view with responsive layouts, added shadow effects, and rounding quarters to enhance the visual hierarchy. 

264
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:57,940
Speaker 1: They don't really even ask for that, but you can know that actually looks pretty nice. 

265
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,700
Speaker 1: I like that a lot. 

266
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:05,400
Speaker 1: So, you know, as we think through frameworks and we think through ways of designing beautiful, engaging, fun applications. 

267
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:13,500
Speaker 1: We can take that as a note of, hey, like this looks really cool and made all UI components adapt to different screen sizes.

268
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,140
Speaker 1: So what do we do now? 

269
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,060
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna test it out. 

270
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:18,830
Speaker 1: So let's do the same thing and enter our website. 

271
00:21:18,870 --> 00:21:20,840
Speaker 1: Okay, first thing, this is good. 

272
00:21:21,930 --> 00:21:24,330
Speaker 1: It didn't add https to the beginning of this. 

273
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,010
Speaker 1: And I want to website. 

274
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:33,990
Speaker 1: So follow up right away, make it so I don't have to type https every time. 

275
00:21:34,390 --> 00:21:35,430
Speaker 1: That's a really great follow up. 

276
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:39,190
Speaker 1: We'll send that in a second as a part of our next prompt for the minute. 

277
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:42,850
Speaker 1: For now, I'm gonna just type in my URL, see what comes through. 

278
00:21:42,890 --> 00:21:44,210
Speaker 1: This is better aligned. 

279
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:45,530
Speaker 1: I think it could still be centered. 

280
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:49,390
Speaker 1: Also, I got a nice little toast there that popped up in the bottom right. 

281
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,760
Speaker 1: These pills are actually now aligned and centered. 

282
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:54,640
Speaker 1: So it's cool that we fix that.

283
00:21:55,410 --> 00:21:58,050
Speaker 1: I like really the way most of this looks. 

284
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,580
Speaker 1: Hence, it looks like everything's coming through. 

285
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,060
Speaker 1: So I check the social media previews. 

286
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,840
Speaker 1: These, let's see, these look better. 

287
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:08,680
Speaker 1: What happens if I resize the screen here? 

288
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:15,170
Speaker 1: So ferry says, looks like these are the, the respond, the widths are coming through a bit better. 

289
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:19,010
Speaker 1: If you recall, these icons were a bit kind of crunched. 

290
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:24,980
Speaker 1: If we go back wide here, we'll just do like iPhone 14 Max, like we'll go old school around the 16 now. 

291
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,300
Speaker 1: But this looks better, right? 

292
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:28,180
Speaker 1: Like we have a more responsive layout. 

293
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,300
Speaker 1: This is a bit more friendly. 

294
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:38,430
Speaker 1: If I'm doing this on my iPhone and I'm starting to get an application that looks better designed and mobile friendly. 

295
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,310
Speaker 1: So this is really cool. 

296
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:45,960
Speaker 1: We're building tools that anyone can use, that we can use to analyze our own websites and at work, which is really fun. 

297
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,820
Speaker 1: So we're gonna call this V1 of our application. 

298
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,180
Speaker 1: And what we're gonna do in the next lesson is add some polish to this. 

299
00:22:53,180 --> 00:23:03,940
Speaker 1: We're gonna go through, we're gonna make some edits in assistant and we're gonna really take our apps to the next level, maybe add some advanced functionality and then deploy. So I'll catch you in the next lesson.
