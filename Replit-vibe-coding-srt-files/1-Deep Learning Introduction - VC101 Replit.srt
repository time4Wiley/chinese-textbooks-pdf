00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:06,360
Speaker 1: Welcome to vive coding one on one with Replett, built in partnership with Replett. 

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:15,350
Speaker 1: In this course, you learn how to code with an AI agent using Rapid provides a cloud environment that allows you to build, host and share apps. 

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:23,040
Speaker 1: And reference recently added a very popular coding agent that makes generating and hosting web based applications fast.

4
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:26,300
Speaker 1: Coding agents are changing how we write codes. 

5
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:30,620
Speaker 1: I still do fair amount of software development myself, but now find it. 

6
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:44,260
Speaker 1: I count on OMS to write mostly code for me to create, take a problem and partition it into manageable blocks and then spend time creating a prompt describing what I want and use a model to produce a code one module at a time. 

7
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:50,790
Speaker 1: And this type of process is making me and many others much more and certainly much faster developers. 

8
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:58,260
Speaker 1: I do want to know that as rapid is a cloud hosted environments, we're unable to present the calls on our usual platform.

9
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:00,520
Speaker 1: And so this is a video only course. 

10
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:08,060
Speaker 1: If you watch only the videos, you learn the key concepts behind using coding agents as well as a process of using alarms to write code. 

11
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:17,870
Speaker 1: Sometimes if you barely looking at the code itself, which somehow call vibe coding, if outside of watching the videos, you want to use reply, you have to create a user account there. 

12
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:26,930
Speaker 1: I'm delighted that instructors for this course are Michaela Catasta, who's president of Raplets, as well as Matt Palmer, whose head of develop relations.

13
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:28,140
Speaker 2: Thanks Andrew. 

14
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,860
Speaker 2: We're really excited to present this course. 

15
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:30,500
Speaker 2: So.

16
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,470
Speaker 1: Michaela, tell me, how have you seen development change for the rise of AI coding agents?

17
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:43,050
Speaker 2: Well, rapidly eliminates many of the barriers that prevent users from building and deploying applications. 

18
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:51,720
Speaker 2: First of all, Rabbi provides a powerful code editor and a universal package manager, so you don't need to struggle with installation of Python and Javascript packages. 

19
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:01,730
Speaker 2: Source control is powered by Git, but we need it as slim as possible for our users and also rapid offers built in key value stores, databases and deployment solutions. 

20
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:08,130
Speaker 2: But now with Rapid Agent, every person in no coding experience can create apps and deploy them in public. 

21
00:02:08,600 --> 00:02:10,600
Speaker 2: He will take you all a few minutes to start. 

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,440
Speaker 2: Even if you did not know many of the terms I just use, you can still build an application. 

23
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,240
Speaker 2: Matt will show exactly how to do it in this course.

24
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,130
Speaker 3: So a popular term today is 5 coding, where you lean into letting the coding agent do most of the heavy lifting. 

25
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:29,400
Speaker 3: We'll maximize the capabilities of the agent, but we'll also show how some planning can improve your results. 

26
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,860
Speaker 3: Along the way, you'll learn some tips and tricks to get the best results possible from our agent. 

27
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:37,930
Speaker 3: We'll start by building a search engine optimization or SEO analyzer. 

28
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,650
Speaker 3: This is a basic app that will get us started and introduce some key concepts. 

29
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:46,210
Speaker 3: Then you'll build a head to head voting app, which will showcase data extraction and storage. 

30
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:49,910
Speaker 3: Throughout the course, we'll learn the basic building blocks of web apps. 

31
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:52,190
Speaker 3: I think you're gonna be surprised at just how much you can build. 

32
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,590
Speaker 3: I know is I certainly have that.

33
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:55,240
Speaker 1: Tone. 

34
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,160
Speaker 1: Your intuition on how to use a coding agent. 

35
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:02,360
Speaker 1: Michaela will also share some of the details behind how rapid is built. 

36
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:15,330
Speaker 1: I hope some of these lessons that they Learned building rapid, which is itself a sophisticated agentic workflow, will also convey useful insights for how you might approach building other agentic AI applications.

37
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:19,330
Speaker 2: Yes, we Learned quite a bit in the last year, and I'm very happy to share.

38
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:19,570
Speaker 1: It. 

39
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,130
Speaker 1: Many people have worked situated schools. 

40
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,880
Speaker 1: I'd like to thank from Deep Linda AI, Hara Salami and Jeff Lothway. 

41
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,360
Speaker 1: Alright, let's get started with the first lesson in the next video.
